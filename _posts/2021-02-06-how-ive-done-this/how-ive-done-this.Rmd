# Distill

These pages have been created using the distill package in R.  To quote its authors: "Distill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.  Learn more about using Distill at <https://rstudio.github.io/distill>."

That's a pretty good summary and the documentation there covers most of the powers of Distill.  However, as with much software documentation, I also felt there were things missing that I needed or that would have speeded things up for me.  It's the usual problem that the people who write the code, and many of the people who use it, are very clever and know what they are doing but don't always remember that we're not all that clever or that some things had become so familiar to them that they don't notice they haven't put those things in the documentation.

So Distill is an R package and I suppose it could be run without [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) but it's clearly designed to dovetail with Rstudio.  So I installed the package and followed the instructions to create a site at https://rstudio.github.io/distill/#creating-an-article.  The system is as they say "a publication format" and they frame it as a tool with which to make a blog.  It actually has what I would call "base pages" as well as pages that it creates as "blog posts".  It took me a while to realise that I had to create pages and posts at the command line with  
`distill::create_article()`  
and  
`distill::create_post()` (with some arguments, pretty much all you need to do with  
`distill::create_post()` is to give the post a title: `distill::create_post("My latest post")`).

The package code creates a template page which is basically Rmarkdown, just as happens when you create a new Rmarkdown page in Rstudio.  You have all the usual Rmarkdown capacities: "knitting" together blocks of code and blocks of text, embedded figures, inline code in text blocks, TeX/LaTeX equation formatting inline and in equation blocks, tables, citations and reference insertion, tables of contents etc.  The help at https://rstudio.github.io/distill goes through the various very nice things the templates can do for you that go a bit beyond what Rmarkdown does:

* code folding (which I have used throughout) which "folds" code away but allows the reader of the page to open it by just clicking 
* nice syntax highlighting in the code blocks pretty much mimicking the syntax highlighting in Rstudio
* you can change theme with css (so I have a Rblog.css file where I've reset the background colour)
* footnotes

There's a lot that has been done to make some of the things you want for open scientific/academic/research publishing easy that is set in "yaml" (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") ... it's a header block above the markdown/markup in many markdown/up files.  My `_site.yml` file (as of 6.ii.21) is this:

```
name: "test2"
title: "Chris (Evans) R SAFAQ"
base_url: https://www.psyctc.org/R_blog
description: |
  CE's pages "blog posts" about using R
output_dir: "_site"
navbar:
  logo:
    image: images/g2_128.gif
    href: https://www.psyctc.org/Rblog/
    icon: images/g2_128.gif
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "Welcome"
      href: "Welcome.html"
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
    - text: "Copyright/permissions"
      href: Copyright_and_permissions.html
output: 
  distill::distill_article:
    theme: Rblog.css
citations: true
cookie_consent:
  style: simple
  type: express
  palette: light
  lang: en
  cookies_policy: url
```

Let's break that up and comment it some things that are perhaps not totally obvious.  (Hm, not sure if you can comment yaml, hm, yes I think you can.)

This first block is defining the whole site.

```
name: "test2" # this is the directory
title: "Chris (Evans) R SAFAQ"
base_url: https://www.psyctc.org/R_blog # this makes sure the pages index to that URL
description: |
  CE's pages "blog posts" about using R
output_dir: "_site" # and this is the directory in which the site is compiled by Distill
```

Distill automatically creates a simple site structure with a navigation bar at the top. The next bits define that.  This first bit just allows you to put an image and icon in.  (I could do with a bigger one!)

```
navbar:
  logo:
    image: images/g2_128.gif
    href: https://www.psyctc.org/Rblog/
    icon: images/g2_128.gif
```

And this bit puts in links to pages you may have created with `distill::create_article()` ... you have to put these into the navigation bar manually by putting lines like these next ones.

```
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "Welcome"
      href: "Welcome.html"
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
    - text: "Copyright/permissions"
      href: Copyright_and_permissions.html
```


```
output: 
  distill::distill_article: # not sure what this does!
    theme: Rblog.css # this is where I invoke my theme/style css
```

Then some very nice convenience powers of the package.

```
citations: true # automatically inserts a nice footnote about citing things on the site
cookie_consent: # and a nice cookie consent for you
  style: simple
  type: express
  palette: light
  lang: en
  cookies_policy: url
```

Pages created with `distill::create_article()`, like all Rmarkdown, start with their own yaml blocks and again these allow some nice things.

  Welcome to my blog which I hope will be useful to people using R to analyse data.

# Automate transfer to my web server

This took me some hours today to sort out but will save me many hours over the years ahead. I suspect that anyone who is more familiar with git than I was will manage to do this much more quickly than I did.  What I've done is:

* install git on the machine on which I'm running Rstudio and storing the site pages
* tell Rstudio that git is there and is to be used for "version control", i.e. automatic backing up of all changes that you "commit" keeping a full historical archive of the changes
* created a free personal account on gitHub (https://github.com/cpsyctc/) and create a respository in it (https://github.com/cpsyctc/Rblog)
* created a personal token which works instead of a password to log into my repository there and makes sure that I'm the only one who can write things to that repository (but anyone can download, "pull" in git terminology, from it) (I have now discovered from https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github.html that these bits might have bee expedited with a )
* use that to "push" each new committed update to the pages to that github repository
* install git on my web server (pretty sure my ISP had already done this actually)
* [this bit, and the next, are linux specific but could be done, though the terminology is different, in Windoze] create a little shell script on the server that "pulls" a copy of the repository content down to the server from github (git handles the tracking of changes and makes sure that only the minimum necessary material is stored and transferred) and uses rsync to copy things to the web pages (rsync, a bit like git, will only copy changed files)
* put a call into crontab to run that little script every ten minutes

So I've now got a site/blog developing here as an Rstudio project that I can commit and push to github (where anyone can pull it if they want it) and which then automatically updates my server, at slowest, ten minutes later.

Now I need to spend a bit more time creating more content but perhaps I'll browse some other people's examples first: see https://pkgs.rstudio.com/distill/articles/examples.html.
