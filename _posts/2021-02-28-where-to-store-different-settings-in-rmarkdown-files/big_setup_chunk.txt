```{r setupy, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

### I often set the working directory here
### That's particularly useful if you are passing a file back and forth
### between colleagues and might each use different working directories
# setwd("/Volumes/NO NAME")

### I'm trying to load all the libraries that are used repeatedly here
library(pander)
library(english)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate) # for the date mangling
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(boot)
library(janitor)
### libraries that are used only within one block I try to load at the top of the block
###   and detach at the end of the block

### If I am bootstrapping or doing anything that calls a random number generator (RNG)
### I set a default seed here
set.seed(12345) # ensure reproducible bootstrap results (subject to changes in sequence of calls)
### However, it's generally wise to reset the seed at the start of any later code block that 
### calls any RNG

### sometimes I use a general storage list to store things to keep the environment simple
lisStore <- list(NULL) # create a general storage list

### finally I set options
options(width = 120)
### this next suppresses messages that seem to "bleed through" for me, despite
### me putting "message=FALSE" in code block headers
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
