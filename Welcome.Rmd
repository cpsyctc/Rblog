Welcome to this first attempt to create a blog that should provide easy access to some Rmarkdown files I'm creating that show R tricks I've found useful.  

Do contact me if you find issues with them or have questions or suggestions.  To do that, use the [contact me](https://www.psyctc.org/psyctc/contact-me/) form on my https://www.psyctc.org/psyctc/ web site.  In most browsers I think that will open in a new page and if you close it when you have sent your message I think that and most browsers will bring you back here.
