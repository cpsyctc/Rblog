They’re not all self-asked, some come from questions from colleagues and supervisees.\nSome things here may link with my CORE work at https://www.coresystemtrust.org.uk/ and if you want to find out more about my non-work life, that’s at https://www.psyctc.org/pelerinage2016/.\nDo contact me if you find issues with them or have questions or suggestions. To do that, use the contact me form on my https://www.psyctc.org/psyctc/ web site. In most browsers I think that will open in a new page and if you close it when you have sent your message I think that and most browsers will bring you back here.\nThis has all been created using the distill package in R (and in Rstudio). Distill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing designed for the web. There is quite a bit more information about distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill but until I found the extremely helpful R-ladies https://rladies.org/ youtube (ugh) presentation by Maëlle Salmon https://masalmon.eu/ at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xyc4-bJjdys I was struggling to get going with the information on the github pages so a big thank you to Maëlle.\n\n\n\n",
