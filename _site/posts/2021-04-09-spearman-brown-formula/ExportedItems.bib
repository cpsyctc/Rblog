	abstract = {The 34-item Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) had demonstrated sound psychometric properties in all samples reported to date (including this study).  However, the unidimensional nature of the 34 items suggests that the BSQ may be unnecessarily long for use in studies when bdoy disparagement is not the main focus of investigation.  This study of 342 adult women presents two 16-item "alternate forms" of the BSQ which showed equivalent means and excellent internal consistency in both derivation and replication samples.  Two 8-item scales were also derived.  The 34-, 16-, and 8-item versions showed equivalent convergent and discriminant validation against the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT)-26  and other parameters.  We suggest that use of the the 16-item versions may be more efficient than the original BSQ where body shape disparagement is not the sole focus of a study, or where a repeated measures design is employed.  Furthermore, the 8-item versions are sufficiently robust to be used as "alternate forms" where speed of completion and economy are of the essence.

	abstract = {Rigorous comparison of the reliability coefficients of several tests or measurement procedures requires a sampling theory for the coefficients.  This paper summarizes the important aspects of the sampling theory for Cronbach's (1951) coefficient alpha, a widely used internal consistency coefficient.  This theory enables researchers to test a specific numerical hypothesis about the population alpha and obtain confidence intervals for the population coefficient.  It also permits researchers to test the hypothesis of equality among several coefficients, either under the condition of independent samples or when the same sample has been used for all measurements.  The procedures are illustrated numerically, and the assumptions and derivations underlying the theory are discussed.
