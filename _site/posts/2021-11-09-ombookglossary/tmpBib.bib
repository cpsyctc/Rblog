In the present article, ways of operationalizing this definition are described, and examples are used to show how clients can be categorized on the basis of this definition.  A reliable change index (RC)  is also proposed to determine whether the magnitude of change for a given client is statistically reliable.  The inclusion of the RC leads to a twofold criterion for clinically significant change."},

  abstract = {"The purpose of this article is to suggest some new directions for the presentation and reporting of data in psychotherapy outcome research.  Statistical comparisons based on group means provide no information on the variability of treatment outcome, and statistical significance tests do not address clinical significance.  Although psychotherapy research has begun to address these issues, it has done so unsystematically.  New standards and conventions are needed to serve as criteria for classifying therapy subjects into categories of improved, unimproved, and deteriorated based on response to treatment.  A two-fold criterion for determining improvement in a client is recommended, based on both statistical reliability and clinical significance.  Statistical procedures for determining whether or not these criteria have been met are discussed."},
