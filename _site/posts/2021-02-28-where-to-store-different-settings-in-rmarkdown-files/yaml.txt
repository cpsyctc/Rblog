Minimal YAML?

---
title: "A title here"
author: "Xxxx Yxxx"
date: "03/01/2021"

output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    toc_depth: 4
    fig_height: 8
    fig_width: 11    
# bibliography: references.bib

More complex YAML

title: "ICCs from multilevel models analysed with lme4 or nlmer"
author: "CE"
date: "26/02/2021"
output:
  html_document:
    # css: "test.css"
    toc: TRUE
    toc_float: FALSE
    dpi: 200
    out.width: "100%"
    fig.height: 40
